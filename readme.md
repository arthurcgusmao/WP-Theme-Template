# About this template

This is a template for beginning a new Wordpress Theme. It has been developed based on the tutorial [Wordpress Theme Development] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpcSpRrAaOaqMA4RdhSnnNcaqOVpX7qi5), from *LearnWebCode* YouTube channel.

You can also use the code written here as a reference in your current theme.

This readme file will only list the functionalities addressed by the template, since code here must be self-documented and easy to understand (if not, please correct it or contact the developer :D).
